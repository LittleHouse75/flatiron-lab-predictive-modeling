<OverallTask>
MidCity General Hospital is facing challenges with bed management and resource allocation. The hospital administration has commissioned your data science team to develop a predictive model that can estimate patient length of stay (LOS) at the time of admission. This will help the hospital:

Optimize staffing levels across departments.
Improve bed management and patient flow.
Reduce costs while maintaining quality of care.
Identify factors that contribute to extended hospital stays.
You have been provided with historical patient data from the past year, including both structured patient information and unstructured clinical notes. Your task is to develop two different approaches to predict length of stay and compare/combine their effectiveness.

<Part1>
Task 1: Setup and Data Exploration
* •	Load the hospital_patient_data.csv dataset using pandas and examine its structure.
* •	Perform exploratory data analysis on the structured fields:
  * ◦	Create target variable based on admission and discharge dates
  * ◦	Relationships between features and target
  * ◦	Correlations between features
  * ◦	Missing value analysis
* •	Create at least 3 visualizations that tell a story about the data.
Task 2: Data Preprocessing
* •	Handle any missing values appropriately.
* •	Convert categorical variables using encoding techniques.
* •	Convert date fields to appropriate features.
* •	Normalize or standardize numeric features as needed.
* •	Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
Task 3: Feature Engineering
* •	Create at least 5 new features that might improve prediction performance.
* •	Utilize data agent to suggest features to create.
Task 4: Model Building
* •	Implement at least 3 different regression models:
  * ◦	Linear Regression (baseline)
  * ◦	Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
  * ◦	One additional model of your choice
* •	Use cross-validation and gridsearch tune hyperparameters.
* •	Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²).
* •	Identify the most important features for predicting length of stay.
Task 5: Analysis and Recommendations
* •	Interpret the best model testing data results.
* •	Identify key factors that influence length of stay.

<Part2>
Task 1: Text Data Exploration
* •	Analyze the patient_notes field.
  * ◦	Distribution of note length.
  * ◦	Common terms and phrases.
* •	Visualize text characteristics.
Task 2: Text Preprocessing
* •	Clean and preprocess the clinical notes.
  * ◦	Remove irrelevant characters.
  * ◦	Normalize.
Task 3: Feature Extraction using Pre-trained Language Models
* •	Use a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT, ClinicalBERT, or similar).
  * ◦	Load the pre-trained model.
  * ◦	Extract features from the clinical notes.
Task 4: Model Building with NLP Features
* •	Build regression models using the text-derived features and pre-trained transformer.
* •	Ensure model is built for regression task.
* •	Fine-tune the model using data.
Task 5: Analysis and Insights
* •	Combine both approach predictions by averaging results.
* •	Determine if certain patient groups are better predicted by text vs. structured data.
* •	Provide insights into what the text models are capturing that structured data might miss.
